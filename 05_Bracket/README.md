- Pseudo Random Number Generation

---

- [x] Write a program that calculates a random number from 1 to 100.\
The program then asks the user to guess the number.\
If the user guesses too high or too low, the program should output "Too High" or "Too Low" accordingly.\
The program must let the user continue to guess until the user correctly guesses the number.

- [ ] **X** Modify the program to output how many guesses it took the user to correctly guess the right number.

- [ ] **X X** Modify the program so that instead of the user guessing a number the computer generated, the computer guesses the number the user has decided. The user must tell the computer whether it guessed too high or too low.

- [ ] **X X X X** Modify the program so that no matter what number the user thinks of (1-100), the computer can guess that number in 7 or less guesses.
