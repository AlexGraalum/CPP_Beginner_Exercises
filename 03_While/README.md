# WHILE (USER == GULLIBLE)

Requires:

- Variables, Data Types, Numerical Operators

- Basic Input/Output

- Logic (If Statements, Switch Statements)

- Loops (For, While, Do-While)

---

- [x] Write a program that continues to ask the user to enter any number other than 5 until the user enters the number 5.\
Then tell the user "Hey! You weren't supposed to enter 5!" and exit the program.

- [x] **X** Modify the program so that after 10 iterations, if the user hasn't entered 5, it will tell the user "Wow, you're more patient than I am. You win!"

- [x] **X X** Modify the program so that it asks the user to enter any number other than the number equal to the number of times they've been asked to enter a number.\
(i.e. on the first iteration "Please enter any number other than 0", the second iteration "Please enter any number other than 1", etc.)\
The program must behave accordingly and exit when the user enters the number they were asked not to.
